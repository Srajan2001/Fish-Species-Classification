## Fish Species Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for a fish species classification model built using InceptionV3.

### Project Overview

The project addresses the challenge of accurately classifying fish species from images. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and require expertise. This project utilizes InceptionV3 for an automated, high-precision classification model.

### Key Features

* **Dataset:** Custom self made dataset of ~6,900 images across five fish species.
* **Model:** InceptionV3 fine-tuned for fish species classification.
* **Accuracy:** Achieves 99% accuracy on the test set.

### Benefits

* Provides a fast, accurate, and accessible tool for fish identification.
* Supports research, conservation efforts, and efficient fisheries management.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (refer to notebook for details).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook (`fish_species_classification.ipynb`) to train and evaluate the model.

### Future Scope

* Expand the model to include more fish species.
* Explore ensemble learning for improved performance.
* Enable real-time classification from video streams.
* Utilize transfer learning for further accuracy gains.
